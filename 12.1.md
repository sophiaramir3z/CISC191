## My challenges in performing the lab:
One challenge was understanding how insertion sort actually moves elements in the sorted portion of the list. At first, I mixed up where the comparisons happen, 
especially because insertion sort compares inside a while-loop instead of a nested for-loop. Another challenge was counting comparisons and swaps correctly. 
I initially counted comparisons even when the inner loop didn’t run, which gave the wrong totals. The last challenge was formatting the output to match the expected format exactly, 
including printing the array after each pass. Once I broke the problem down step by step, the implementation became more straightforward.

## My code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InsertionSortLab {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int size = sc.nextInt();
        int[] numbers = new int[size];

        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            numbers[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        // Print initial array
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println();

        int comparisons = 0;
        int swaps = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
            int j = i;

            while (j > 0) {
                comparisons++;

                if (numbers[j] < numbers[j - 1]) {
                    // swap
                    int temp = numbers[j];
                    numbers[j] = numbers[j - 1];
                    numbers[j - 1] = temp;
                    swaps++;
                    j--;
                } else {
                    break; // no more shifting needed
                }
            }

            // print array after each pass
            for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {
                System.out.print(numbers[k] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("comparisons: " + comparisons);
        System.out.println("swaps: " + swaps);
    }
}
